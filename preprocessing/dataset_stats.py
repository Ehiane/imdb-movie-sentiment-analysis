"""
Dataset Statistics Logger
=========================

This module provides insights into the IMDb dataset, helping verify 
that the data is correctly structured before training a neural network.

The function logs:
- The number of training and testing samples.
- The average length of reviews before padding.
- The distribution of sentiment labels (0 = negative, 1 = positive).

Understanding these statistics is essential for preprocessing and 
ensuring the dataset is balanced.

Functions:
----------
- log_dataset_statistics(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
  Logs dataset statistics including size, label distribution, and review lengths.
